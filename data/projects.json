Now, I have filled that rather large void with Ohmpage. Sorted into categorical icons below the search bar, links are served in a dropdown list with pop-out labels offering brief descriptions. As well as being a link-hub, Ohmpage offers the user the choice to change their background, theme (light/dark) and search-engine, with preferences saved locally in browser storage.",
